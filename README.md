# EatBett3r

**EatBett3r** is a blockchain-based food and grocery marketplace that prioritizes health and sustainability. By leveraging the VeChainThor Blockchain, our platform connects environmentally-conscious consumers with grocery stores offering sustainable products. EatBett3r incentivizes consumers to make healthier and more sustainable choices by rewarding them with BETT3R tokens. Additionally, it holds vendors accountable through a unique review system that requires consumers to stake tokens when posting reviews. This creates a transparent and honest ecosystem where both vendors and consumers are rewarded for their commitment to sustainability.

- **Health Promotion**: Offers organic and sustainably sourced products, rewarding consumers for making health-conscious choices.

## Token Economics
